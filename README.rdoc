== Developers

We are still working on the database schema, so to avoid creating a myriad of new migrations we just modify
previous one.

In order to update your local codebase after pulling the code please do so:

		git pull origin master
		rake db:drop
		rake db:migrate

This will re-run all the migrations and leave you with a clean database
